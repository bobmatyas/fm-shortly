# URL Shortening API Landing Page

This is my solution to a layout challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

It uses ReactJS to integrate with the rel.link URL shortening API to generate short links based on user input. It makes use of Styled Components for the styling and integrates an NPM package for the copy function. Shortened links persist across reloads by storing them in local storage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
